# GXDE-DummyApps

This repository contains the source for some placeholder packages, which will guide the users to install the actual packages in the app store. These packages are supposed to be preinstalled on fresh installs, thus reducing installation media size.

This source package is designed to build multiple dummy packages.

## Building

This repository is solely used to build packages therefore you should install Debian packaging programs.

App configs are put under `src/` , please refer to the format at `debian/_____.install`  to maintain more dummy apps
